# Phased LSTM implementation in Tensorflow

Welcome to the Tensorflow implementation of the recently introduced
[Phased LSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09513) by Neil et. al @ NIPS 2016 

You can find [here](https://github.com/dannyneil/public_plstm) the original implementation from Daniel Neil (in Theano) 

## Results
Here is the results of frequency discrimination at high resolution sampling
(described in the paper): in dark blue you see PLSTM that converges way faster then GRU (in light blue)

## Implementation

Here I implemented the [PLSTM](PhasedLSTMCell.py) in a plug-and-play fashion such that if you wanna 
use it in one of your models you can switch from LSTMCell/GRUCell to PhasedLSTMCell.

The core of the PLSTM is 
```python
    tau = vs.get_variable(
        "T", shape=[self._num_units],
        initializer=random_exp_initializer(0, self.tau_init), dtype=dtype)

    r_on = vs.get_variable(
        "R", shape=[self._num_units],
        initializer=init_ops.constant_initializer(self.r_on_init), dtype=dtype)

    s = vs.get_variable(
        "S", shape=[self._num_units],
        initializer=init_ops.random_uniform_initializer(0., tau.initialized_value()), dtype=dtype)
        # for backward compatibility (v < 0.12.0) use the following line instead of the above
        # initializer = init_ops.random_uniform_initializer(0., tau), dtype = dtype)

    tau_broadcast = tf.expand_dims(tau, dim=0)
    r_on_broadcast = tf.expand_dims(r_on, dim=0)
    s_broadcast = tf.expand_dims(s, dim=0)

    r_on_broadcast = tf.abs(r_on_broadcast)
    tau_broadcast = tf.abs(tau_broadcast)
    times = tf.tile(times, [1, self._num_units])

    # calculate kronos gate
    phi = tf.div(tf.mod(tf.mod(times - s_broadcast, tau_broadcast) + tau_broadcast, tau_broadcast),
                 tau_broadcast)
    is_up = tf.less(phi, (r_on_broadcast * 0.5))
    is_down = tf.logical_and(tf.less(phi, r_on_broadcast), tf.logical_not(is_up))

    k = tf.select(is_up, phi / (r_on_broadcast * 0.5),
                  tf.select(is_down, 2. - 2. * (phi / r_on_broadcast), self.alpha * phi))
```
then the kronos gate is applied to the cell simply by
```python
        c = k * c + (1. - k) * c_prev
        m = k * m + (1. - k) * m_prev
```
PhasedLSTMCell has the same parameters set has the LSTMCell plus, 
here I report the default parameters (as indicated by the paper) 

- The slope in the off period of the gate
```python        
   alpha=0.001
```
- The initial value of r_on
```python        
        r_on_init=0.05
```        
- The parameter for the initial sampling of tau
```python
        tau_init=6.
```  
  tau is sampled as ~exp(uniform(0, tau_init))      

## Notes for backward compatibility (v < 0.12.0) 

The current implementation uses Tensorflow 0.12.0.
If you don't wanna update Tensorflow (BTW you should :)) I inserted in the code 
some commented lines to be backward compatible.

In [PLSTM](PhasedLSTMCell.py)
```python
    initializer=init_ops.random_uniform_initializer(0., tau.initialized_value()), dtype=dtype)
    # for backward compatibility (v < 0.12.0) use the following line instead of the above
    # initializer = init_ops.random_uniform_initializer(0., tau), dtype = dtype)
```  
In the [unit test](simplePhasedLSTM.py)
```python
    sess.run(init)
    # for backward compatibility (v < 0.12.0) use the following line instead of the above
    # initialize_all_variables(sess)
```    
Remember also to change the summaries calls, that is:
```python
    tf.summary.scalar -> tf.scalar_summary 
    tf.summary.histogram -> tf.histogram_summary 
    tf.summary.FileWriter -> tf.train.SummaryWriter 
    tf.summary.merge -> tf.merge_summary 
```
## Paper's Task

I implemented the first task described in the paper, that is frequency 
discrimination. The network is presented with sine waves and has to 
discriminate between waves of a target range of frequencies (e.g. 5-6 Hz) 
and waves outside of this range.
Furthermore there are three different ways in which you can sample these sine waves:
- Low resolution (1 ms)
- High resolution (0.1 ms)
- Asynchronously 

The 3 ways are implemented and you can select them with the flags.

## Update 17-02-2017

Transition to tensorflow v1.0
The folder has now two different scripts to support v1.0 and older
To use v1.0 refer to [PLSTM_v1](PhasedLSTMCell_v1.py)

Updated also 
```python
    outputs = multiPLSTM(cells, inputs, lens, n_input, initial_states)
```

now the function takes a list of cells previously generated, in this 
way you can paramterize every cell separately.

The function supports also in place copy of initial states
